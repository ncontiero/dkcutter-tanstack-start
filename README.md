## Usage

To scaffold an application using [DKCutter](https://dkcutter.ncontiero.com/), run any of the following commands and answer the command prompt questions:

### npm

```bash
npx dkcutter@latest gh:ncontiero/dkcutter-tanstack-start
```

### yarn

```bash
yarn dlx dkcutter@latest gh:ncontiero/dkcutter-tanstack-start
```

### pnpm

```bash
pnpm dlx dkcutter@latest gh:ncontiero/dkcutter-tanstack-start
```

### bun

```bash
bunx dkcutter@latest gh:ncontiero/dkcutter-tanstack-start
```

You'll be prompted for some values. Provide them, and a tailored TanStack Start project will be created for you.

**Warning**: After generation, ensure you update 'author name' and other specific details to your own information.

Answer the prompts with your own desired [options][options-url]. For example:

```bash
✔ What is the project name? … My Awesome Project
✔ What is the project slug? … my-awesome-project
✔ What is the project description? … Behold My Awesome Project!
✔ What is the author name? … Nicolas Contiero <https://github.com/ncontiero>
✔ What is the project version? … 0.1.0
✔ Which Authentication Provider would you like to use? › None / Clerk / Better Auth
✔ Which Additional Tools would you like to use? › Husky, Lint Staged, Nano Staged, Commitlint, ESlint + Type Information, Prisma, Trigger.dev, Tanstack Query, Shadcn, Tailwind CSS Typography, Unpic
✔ Which Automated Dependency Updater do you want to use? › None / Mend Renovate / Github Dependabot
✔ Which Deployment Host would you like to use? › None / Cloudflare / Netlify / Nitro (agnostic) / Vercel
✔ Bun detected. Use it as the Server Runtime for My Awesome Project? … No / Yes

Next steps:
  cd my-awesome-project
  pnpm install
  git add .
  git commit -m "initial commit"
  pnpm dev

✔ Project created!
```

Enter the project and take a look around:

```bash
cd my-awesome-project/
ls
```

Now take a look at your repo. Don't forget to carefully look at the generated `README.md`.

## Advanced Usage

If you want to bypass the interactive prompts and start faster, you can provide configuration via CLI flags. All options in `dkcutter.json` are available as flags:

### Examples

Generate a project using Prisma and Unpic:

```bash
pnpm dlx dkcutter gh:ncontiero/dkcutter-tanstack-start --additionalTools prisma,unpic
```

If you want to use all the default values with the exception of one or more, you can do it as follows:

```bash
pnpm dlx dkcutter gh:ncontiero/dkcutter-tanstack-start --authProvider clerk -y
```

This will use the default values, with the exception of the `--authProvider` option, skipping the interactive prompt (`-y`).
